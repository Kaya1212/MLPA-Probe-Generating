# MLPA-Probe-Generating
This project includes two programs written in Python for generating Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) probes. MLPA.py generates hybridising sequences for both halves. It can take multiple sequences of multiple exons as an intake. Criteria for the probe generation are primarly taken from the MLPA probe design protocol from MRC-Holland. LPO_RPO.py takes the hybridising sequences from MLPA.py as an input and attaches primer binding site and stuffer sequence to them, to make the probes fit into the refernce probemix P300-100R by MRC Holland.
